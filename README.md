<B> Contents: </B> This repository contains processed image data and scripts required to analyse spatially resolved RNA-seq with high-throughput time course scRNA-seq to study the spatiotemporal interactions and regulatory programs that drive fetal development of the chicken hearts. The sequencing data needed for this analysis have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149457"> GSE149457 </a>.
